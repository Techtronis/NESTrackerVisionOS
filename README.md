NESTracker is now on Apple Vision Pro through [Testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Fb6LPVzi) or by downloading this IPA and installing it on your Vision Pro (if its even possible lol) Tell me if there are any issues as I can't afford a Vision Pro and don't even live in a country that currently sells it
